This repository is a comprehensive collection of our team's work on exploring and analyzing the correlation between cancer-related death rates and socioeconomic indicators in the United States. Our main goal is to identify the most critical factors that contribute to cancer fatalities by using advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models. The datasets we use in this repository cited from the   public-access data website data.world: https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge.

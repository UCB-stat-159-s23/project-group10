This repository has our team's processes and files to analyze cancer-related death rates and socioeconomic indicators. Our objective is to identify critical factors that contribute to cancer fatalities in the US, using statistical techniques and machine learning models. We want to pinpoint which factors have the most significant impact on cancer death rates among different populations. The insights gained will inform targeted public health initiatives and policies to reduce cancer fatalities and improve well-being.
